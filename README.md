## General info
* Target group: children 5 â€“ 11 years and parents, nature/wildlife enthusiasts
* Rationale: During lockdown children are even more detached from nature than before. Web page containing seasonal London wildlife (plants, flowers, bugs and animals) could provide learning and entertainment platform.
* Method: Web page scraping Instagram, Facebook and Tweeter hashtags, possibly publishing short stories written by anyone. It could have quizzes and games if there is someone techy enough to build that
